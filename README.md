# CS-300
For this project, I needed to create a program that would take a file, parse each line, and gather each course information. The course information included its course number, title, and if any prerequisites, their course numbers. The program would need to check for file errors, and if any prerequisite for a course was its own course somewhere within the file. I approached this problem by taking each line from the file, parsing it while checking for errors, and using a separate method to locate the prerequisite if a course had any. Once the file was completely parsed, the vector that held each course was sorted alphanumerically. This benefited the loading data structures method ensuring courses were loaded in order. My work on this project improved the way I think about a program as a whole. It was my first time creating the entire code for a project. I've always had comments throughout my code, but I did implement the definitions of each function similar to the code we've seen throughout the course. Overall, I enjoyed this class and this project.
